When I sat down with [Dan Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8422540) at Bridgeport Brewing and accepted one of the first developer jobs at [Cascade Energy](https://cascadeenergy.com/), the thing I was most excited about was the prospect of building a development culture from the ground up. [Will](https://github.com/nackjicholson) and I had tried to implement dev culture in the agencies we work at previously, but development work had always been supplementary and the process innovations we craved were just too far from the center of the business to make much progress.

This time would be different. We were developing software. A product. The work would be at the center. We could implement the stringent coding standards and strict quality control that we'd always craved. We were going to build something beautiful. A team of like-minds that worked together as fluidly through git branches as an NBA offense. The world didn't stand a chance.

But then there was the contracted team. And onboarding. And deadlines. We hired [a senior architect](https://github.com/cberube) and realized how little we knew. We moved offices and moved development fully inhouse and were desperate to prove ourselves. And more onboarding and more deadlines. The occasional conversation about "thought leadership" sounded more and more far-fetched. Eventually we just stopped talking about it. And then we stopped thinking about it.

Until last week during a meeting with [the CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marcus-wilcox/17/453/46B) when he asked us, "do you feel that other groups at cascade understand"
