When I sat down with [Dan Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=8422540) at Bridgeport Brewing and accepted one of the first developer jobs at [Cascade Energy](https://cascadeenergy.com/), the thing I was most excited about was the prospect of building a development culture from the ground up. [Will](https://github.com/nackjicholson) and I had tried and failed to achieve this at the agencies we'd previously work at, but there was never the focus or importance on coding necessary to adopt the rigor we craved.

This time would be different. We making software now. A product. The code was right at the center of everything, and we could hone our craft and give our tasks the respect and reflection we felt like they deserved. 

Standards would be democratically created and dogmatically followed. The intellectual challenges would be debated, solved, and agreed upon over cross-legged conversations. Our team would be like a military unit in it's precision. All parts contributing to the objective with no room for heroics or personal glory. We would responded to obstacles like an NBA offense, flowing around them git branches and capitalizing on each otherâ€™s strengths.

But then there was friction with the contracted team. And on-boarding. And deadlines. We hired [a senior architect](https://github.com/cberube) and realized how little we knew. We moved offices, moved development in-house, moved platforms, moved floors, moved languages, moved and moved again. We were desperate to prove ourselves. And then there was more on-boarding and deadlines.

During all that change we made a lot of progress. We adopted and codified better practices, quantified success, released updates more often. But we left one piece behind. Something from that original dream that drew us here in the first place.

The occasional conversation about "thought leadership" sounded more and more far-fetched. Hollow. Unrealistic even. Eventually we stopped talking about it at all. And then we stopped thinking about it. We settled into our workstations, put on our headphones, and only broke the silence with our key strokes.

Until last week.

When [our CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marcus-wilcox/17/453/46B) confronted us with the question: "do you feel that other groups at cascade understand what you do."* We squirmed uncomfortably in our seats, protested busyness, ducked and weaved responsibility to the best of our ability. With the patience of a father, he refuted all of our points until we were staring at an ugly truth. We'd stopped trying.

We'd stopped trying to communicate why what we do is so *exciting*. We'd stopped 
  
*I am completely paraphrasing &mdash; I wish I could remember the verbatim &mdash; but it was something to that effect.
