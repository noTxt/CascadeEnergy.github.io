title: About Us
---

We are a growing team of software specialists housed within the engineering organization [Cascade Energy](https://cascadeenergy.com/company/). Espousing the values of *smart, sustained, and measurable improvement* &mdash; Cascade developed a standard of excellence over 20+ years in the industrial energy-efficiency sector. We apply that standard of excellence to the development of software.

We build scalable, high-quality systems for energy monitoring. We achieve scale through leveraging the best available [technologies](http://aws.amazon.com/), and we achieve quality through rigorous [coding practice](/coding_standards). Our [SENSEI](http://energysensei.com/) product has won Environmental Leader's [Product of the Year](http://www.environmentalleader.com/environmental-leader-product-project-awards/), and we continue to iterate upon it using [agile methodology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

We work collaboratively and emphasize peer review. We frequently ( but not dogmatically ) use [pair programing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming), we take estimates seriously and require a group vote before committing to a scope of work, and we take pains to spread system knowledge across the team. Before it goes into production, every line of code is reviewed by *at least two other team members*.

Above all, we love solving complex problems &mdash; sustainably. We read the 
latest blogs, attend and host [user-groups](http://www.meetup.com/PDX-PHP), 
go to [industry-leading 
conferences](http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015). We try to be better
 every day. But we do it sustainably. We 
force our team to leave work so that they can arrive the next day refreshed and excited to code.

Because we think that's the only way you can achieve **smart, sustained, and measurable improvement**.
