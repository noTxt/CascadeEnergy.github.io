A small team of software engineers [devoted](/developer_agreement) to building the [best applications possible](/coding_standards), Cascade Development started in 2013 with the [SENSEI](http://energysensei.com/) product.

Housed within the organization of [Cascade Energy](https://cascadeenergy.com/company/), our development team strives to live the Cascade ideals of *smart, sustained, and measurable* in the context of software.
